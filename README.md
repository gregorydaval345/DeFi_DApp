# DeFi_DApp
DeFi yield farming DApp

Building a Escrow smart contract with a few custom features:

- ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 support
- Yield farming (deposits accruing interest)
- Governance/upgradability support
- Access control or multisig features for pooled assets

These should have tests built using Hardhat and documentation done using NatSpec.
